# Programming of a user group server in Java RMI.

A centralized user group server will be implemented, providing routines for creating and deleting groups, registering and deregistering members, as well as blocking and unblocking members' registrations and deregistrations.

Participating users will have a textual name (alias), as well as the groups in which they participate. Customers can create new groups, becoming their owners, and only they will be able to delete the groups they have created.
